# Chisel 3 Lab Templates and Examples

This repository contains a collection of hardware design examples and templates implemented in [Chisel 3](https://www.chisel-lang.org/). It serves as a learning resource or a starting point for laboratory assignments involving digital logic design, specifically focusing on matrix operations, memory systems (cache), and Network-on-Chip (NoC).

## Project Structure

The source code is located in `src/main/scala/` and is organized into the following packages:

*   **`madd`**: Matrix Addition examples.
    *   `MatrixAddition1.scala`: Single-Cycle matrix addition implementation.
    *   `MatrixAddition2.scala`: Multi-Cycle matrix addition implementation.
    *   `MatrixAddition3.scala`: Pipelined matrix addition implementation.
*   **`cache`**: Cache memory implementation examples.
    *   `Cache1.scala`: A basic cache sample.
*   **`noc`**: Network-on-Chip (NoC) implementation.
    *   Contains components for Routers, Network Interfaces, Packet Generation, and Routing Algorithms.
    *   `NoCSimulatorTop.scala`: Top-level simulation module for the NoC.
    *   `routing/`: Routing algorithms.
    *   `traffic/`: Traffic generation patterns.
*   **`common`**: Common utility modules and helper functions.
    *   Includes utilities like `Demux`, `LFSR16WithRandomSeed`, etc.

## Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you need the following tools installed:

*   **Scala** (Project is configured for 2.12.12)
*   **sbt** (Scala Build Tool)
*   **Chisel 3** (Version 3.4.1)
*   **Verilator** (Optional, for running simulations generated by Chisel)

## Usage

This project uses `sbt` for building, testing, and running the Chisel code. A `Makefile` is provided to simplify common tasks.

### Generating Verilog

To generate Verilog code from the Chisel sources, you can use the `make verilog` command. By default, it is configured to run the `noc.NoCSimulatorTop` main class.

```bash
make verilog
```

To generate Verilog for other modules (e.g., Matrix Addition or Cache), you can modify the `Makefile` or run `sbt` commands directly:

```bash
sbt "runMain madd.MatrixAddition1"
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests defined in the project:

```bash
make test
```

*Note: The `Makefile` currently has some test commands commented out. You may need to uncomment the lines corresponding to the module you are working on (e.g., `madd.MatrixAddition1Tester`).*

## Development Environment

It is recommended to use an IDE that supports Scala, such as:
*   **Visual Studio Code** with the **Metals** extension.
*   **IntelliJ IDEA** with the **Scala** plugin.

If you are using a Docker container provided by your instructor, ensure you attach to the container as per the instructions.
